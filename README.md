This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a beautiful, intricate flower-like pattern with alternating yellow and red colors. The pattern is formed by drawing concentric circles with decreasing radii, with each circle being divided into four quarters with alternating colors. The hideturtle() function is used to hide the turtle, making the pattern more visually appealing.
Features
Alternating colors: The pattern features alternating yellow and red colors, creating a striking visual effect. Intricate design: The concentric circles with decreasing radii create a intricate and complex pattern. Flower-like shape: The pattern resembles a flower, with the alternating colors creating a sense of movement and energy.

Run
To run this code, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., rainbow_flower_bloom.py) and execute it using Python (e.g., python rainbow_flower_bloom.py). This will launch a window displaying the Rainbow Flower Bloom pattern.
